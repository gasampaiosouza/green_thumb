## Details

Application has 3 `selects` (that aren't selects, hope it doesn't change anything), and when you fill all of them the application send to API the parameters you selected by Jquery's AJAX and return some recommendations. <br />
Client side get this recommendations, remove before recommendations (if there are any) and create a new box to every data object it receives.

**It was made with**

* HTML
* CSS (Scss)
* Javascript (Jquery)

> Coded with: VS Code.

## Run

To run the application, just clone repo and execute `index.html`.
