> second one is being hovered.

## Details

Application has 3 `selects` (that aren't selects, hope it doesn't change anything), and when you fill all of them, the application send to you some plants recommendations by Jquery's AJAX. <br />
Client side get this recommendations and create a new box to every data object it receives.

**It was made with**

* HTML
* CSS (Scss)
* Javascript (Jquery)

## Run

To run the application, just clone repo and execute `index.html`.

## Thank you!
